README.md for Mini Todo Management Project using Spring Boot + Spring MVC + Spring Security + JSP + Hibernate + MySQL

## Overview
This project is a mini todo management web application that demonstrates the use of Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, JSP, Hibernate, and MySQL. 

The project implements basic CRUD operations for Todo Management such as creating, updating, deleting, listing and retrieving a todo by id. Spring Security is implemented to secure the application, and Webjars is used to manage client-side dependencies such as CSS and JS. JSP is used as a view, along with a common header, footer, and navigation bar. A custom error page mapping is also implemented.

## Features
- Create, Update, Delete, List and Get a Todo by id.
- Simple Spring Security
- Webjars to manage client-side dependencies (CSS and JS).
- JSP as a view with common header, footer, and navigation bar.
- Custom error page mapping

You can also implement the following additional features to this Todo Management project as an exercise:
- Finish Todo feature: Add a finish button and save the status against each record in a database.
- Logging: Refer to this article to implement logging effectively in this Todo management project: Spring Boot 2 Logging SLF4j Logback and LOG4j2 Example.
- Role-based spring security: Refer to this article to implement role-based Spring security effectively in this Todo management project: Spring Boot + Spring MVC + Role-Based Spring Security + JPA + Thymeleaf + MySQL Tutorial.
- Exception handling: Refer to this article to implement exception handling effectively in this Todo management project: Spring Boot 2 Exception Handling for REST APIs.
- Validation: Refer to this article to implement validation effectively in this Todo management project: Spring Boot CRUD REST APIs Validation Example.
- Auditing: Refer to this article to implement auditing effectively in this Todo management project: Spring Data JPA Auditing with Spring Boot 2 and MySQL Example.

## Getting Started
### Tools and Technologies Used
- Spring Boot - 2.0.4.RELEASE
- JDK - 1.8 or later
- Spring Framework - 5.0.8 RELEASE
- Hibernate - 5.2.17.Final
- Maven - 3.2+

### Creating and Importing a Project
There are many ways to create a Spring Boot application. The simplest way is to use Spring Initializr at http://start.spring.io/, which is an online Spring Boot application generator.

To create the project:
1. Go to http://start.spring.io/.
2. Generate a Maven project with Java version 1.8 or later.
3. Add dependencies: Web, JPA, MySQL, DevTools, and Security.
4. Click on the Generate Project button to generate the project and download it.
5. Unzip the downloaded zip file and import it into your favorite IDE.

Note that we have used Spring Data JPA starter to talk to MySQL database.

### Running the Application
1. Configure MySQL database properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
2. Run the following command to build and run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
3. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Conclusion
This project is a simple yet comprehensive demonstration of how to develop Spring MVC web applications using Spring Boot. It provides a good starting
